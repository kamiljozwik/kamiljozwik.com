GitHub is revolutionizing software development through its [experimental projects](https://githubnext.com/) and deep integration of artificial intelligence.

Today, many organizations keep their code on GitHub and have signed agreements regarding the privacy of that code. A sizable number of organizations also have paid licenses for their developers. As the issue of code security and privacy is often a roadblock in the adaptation of AI tools, so it's worth knowing what opportunities GitHub gives us here, since we already keep our code there anyway ðŸ™‚

In this post, I'll explore GitHubâ€™s current AI capabilities, highlighting how each tool can practically benefit your development workflow.

As soon as new tools are available in the future, I will update this post with the latest information.

## GitHub Copilot: Your AI pair programmer

[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) represents a major leap in developer productivity by acting as an AI pair programmer. Designed to understand your code context and generate relevant suggestions in real time, Copilot integrates seamlessly into your development workflow. Let's make a high-level overview of this tool, outlining its core features, benefits, and what makes it a compelling tool for modern software development.

### What is GitHub Copilot?

I think today it's hard to find a developer who hasn't heard of or used Copilot, but perhaps this post is being read by someone who isn't a programmer, so let me do a brief introduction. GitHub Copilot leverages advanced machine learning models, specifically trained on vast amounts of open-source code, to assist developers by suggesting complete lines or even whole blocks of code. It can help you:

- **Accelerate coding tasks:** by auto-completing boilerplate code and repetitive patterns.
- **Improve code quality:** offering suggestions that align with best practices.
- **Inspire new solutions:** providing alternative approaches that you might not have considered.

Copilot is not intended to replace the developer; rather, it acts as a smart assistant that augments their capabilities by reducing the time spent on mundane tasks.

More information about Copilot can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/about-github-copilot/what-is-github-copilot).

### Agent awakens

As of the date of writing this post (March 2025), Copilot does well with autocomplete and in generating individual code snippets [during chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat), but we then have to transfer code to the files ourselves.

There is also a feature called [Copilot Edits](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-edits), but it stays behind with automatic edition of multiple files (agentic coding) e.g. [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/). All this should change when the functionality available for now in [VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) is introduced into the production version of Copilot. If everything works stably and as it [does in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C95drFKy4ss), then Copilot can take over the primacy as an programming copilot, making tools like Cursor or [Cline](https://cline.bot/) less relevant.

### Subscription and adoption considerations

GitHub offers Copilot as part of its subscription plans, reflecting the toolâ€™s value for both individual developers and enterprise teams. Organizations that have already invested in GitHubâ€™s ecosystem might find Copilot a natural extension to enhance their coding efficiency.

Copilot is also available for free with the limit of 2000 completions and 50 messages (using Chat) per month. Price for individuals is $10 per month ($100 USD per year), so it is relatively cheap for what it offers.

Full pricing can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/about-github-copilot/subscription-plans-for-github-copilot) and [here](https://github.com/features/copilot/plans).

## Copilot Workspace: Streamlining Development with Natural Language

Currently available in public preview, Copilot Workspace is designed to minimize cognitive load and facilitate deeper focus on problem-solving.

**Intuitive Planning:**
Simply describe your coding task in plain English, and Copilot Workspace generates structured, actionable plans based on your existing codebase and related discussions.

**AI-Assisted Implementation:**
Within these generated plans, Workspace suggests precise code implementations, allowing you to review, refine, and deploy seamlessly.

**Integrated Testing & Collaboration:**
This environment supports built-in testing and debugging, integrated version control, and real-time collaborationâ€”making teamwork frictionless and efficient.

## GitHub Spark: Democratizing App Creation

GitHub Spark, currently in technical preview, empowers usersâ€”even those without traditional coding expertiseâ€”to rapidly create functional micro-apps, or "sparks," entirely through natural language.

**No-Code Micro-App Development:**
Describe your app concept in conversational English, and Spark instantly translates it into a fully functional, hosted application.

**Interactive Refinement:**
Real-time interactive previews enable continuous iteration and refinement, allowing immediate feedback as you articulate new features or adjustments.

**Easy Sharing and Collaboration:**
Effortlessly share your micro-apps with team members, facilitating collaboration and collective innovation with intuitive permission settings.

## AI-Powered Code Reviews: Enhancing Quality and Efficiency

GitHubâ€™s Copilot-powered code reviews, now in public preview, integrate seamlessly into existing workflows to augment human reviewers.

**Automated Insights & Recommendations:**
Copilot scans proposed changes, proactively identifying potential issues and recommending specific improvements that can be applied with minimal effort.

**Seamless Pull Request Integration:**
Easily request and manage AI-assisted code reviews directly within GitHub.com or Visual Studio Code, accelerating feedback cycles without compromising the critical role of human judgment.

## GitHub Model Catalog: Your Gateway to AI Models

The GitHub Model Catalog simplifies the integration of AI capabilities by offering centralized access to a curated selection of leading AI models.

**Diverse and Accessible AI Models:**
Explore and integrate models from renowned providers such as Azure OpenAI Service, Mistral, Meta, Cohere, NVIDIA, and Hugging Face, tailored specifically to your project needs.

**Interactive Experimentation:**
Utilize the built-in interactive playground to experiment with model responses, fine-tune parameters, and rapidly prototype solutions without extensive setup.

**Effortless Integration:**
Seamlessly incorporate your chosen models into your existing development workflows via GitHub Codespaces and familiar APIs and SDKs.

## Conclusion: Embracing AI for Modern Development

GitHubâ€™s suite of AI-driven tools empowers developers by streamlining workflows, reducing manual tasks, and enhancing collaboration. From intelligent coding assistance and streamlined workspace environments to democratized app creation and efficient code reviews, GitHub is transforming how software teams operate.
