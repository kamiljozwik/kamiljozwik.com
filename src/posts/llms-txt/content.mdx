`llms.txt` is a new [proposed standard](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/llms-txt) for websites to provide a file that helps Large Language Models (LLMs) understand and use website content more effectively.

From the technical point of view, it is a streamlined, Markdown-formatted file designed to provide LLMs with the most relevant website content quickly and efficiently. Much like how `robots.txt` or `sitemap.xml` guides search engines, `llms.txt` targets AI inference by summarizing a website’s key components without the noise of navigation menus, ads, or complex HTML structures.

For example, if an LLM needs to answer a question about a software library's documentation, `llms.txt` could provide a quick overview and direct it to the right resources, making responses faster and more accurate.

## Why?

This initiative, first proposed in September 2024 by Jeremy Howard and detailed on platforms like [llmstxt.org](https://llmstxt.org), aims to address the growing reliance of LLMs on web content while acknowledging their technical limitations.

Traditional web pages are optimized for human engagement, not for LLMs, which must extract relevant information from an ocean of HTML, JavaScript, and other extraneous elements.

Converting such complex structures into LLM-friendly plain text is imprecise and inefficient, as noted in the proposal on [answer.ai](https://www.answer.ai/posts/2024-09-03-llmstxt.html).

By implementing `llms.txt`, website owners can offer a curated "map" of their content, thereby:

- **Enhancing context utilization**:
  LLMs operate within a limited context window. A well-crafted `llms.txt` file ensures that only the most pertinent details are processed, leading to more accurate and context-rich responses.

- **Reducing processing overhead**:
  Instead of parsing an entire webpage, LLMs can directly refer to the `llms.txt` file to locate documentation, APIs, or support resources.

## File structure

The structure of `llms.txt` aims to be standardized to ensure consistency across websites. According to [llmstxt.org](https://llmstxt.org/#example), it should include the following sections:

| Section                          | Details                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **H1 header**                    | Required, name of the project or site (e.g. `# Awesome Lib`)                                                                                                        |
| **Blockquote**                   | Required, short summary with key information necessary for understanding the rest of the file (e.g., `> This is a python library...`)                               |
| **Additional markdown sections** | Optional, any type except headings, for detailed information about the project and file interpretation                                                              |
| **File lists (H2 headers)**      | Optional, each a markdown list with required hyperlinks `[name](url)` and optional notes after `:`, e.g., `- [Link title](https://link_url): Optional link details` |
| **Optional section**             | Special meaning, if included, URLs can be skipped for shorter context, marked with `## Optional`                                                                    |

This structure allows for flexibility while ensuring LLMs can parse the file using classical programming techniques like `parsers` and `regex`.

Several early adopters are experimenting with dual versions of the file:

- `llms.txt`: A high-level overview for quick AI processing.
- `llms-full.txt`: An extended version that includes comprehensive details for deeper context.

This dual-approach lets LLMs decide the level of detail needed based on query complexity, making it adaptable for diverse applications — from technical documentation to e-commerce product details.

### Examples

There is already in place a [curated directory](https://directory.llmstxt.cloud/) of products and companies leading the adoption of the `llms.txt` standard. You can use this directory to find examples when creating your own `llms.txt` file.

There are also tools like [firecrawl.dev](https://www.firecrawl.dev/blog/How-to-Create-an-llms-txt-File-for-Any-Website) and [wordlift.io](https://wordlift.io/generate-llms-txt/) that offer generators to create `llms.txt` files. These tools process the site, extract key information, and produce both standard and expanded versions (e.g., `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt`).

You can find this (although tiny) file on [my page](https://kamiljozwik.com/llms.txt) as well.

## Adoption

As of March 2025, adoption is still emerging, with tools like [Mintlify](https://docs.anthropic.com/llms-full.txt) adding support for thousands of dev tools' docs, as mentioned [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/llms-txt-414d5121bcb3/).

However, there is controversy around its necessity, with some arguing it's premature given the rapid evolution of LLMs, while others see it as a forward-thinking move. Discussions on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41439983) reflect mixed sentiments, with concerns about standardization and potential overload of new web files.

Hot or not? We must wait and see.

## Future implications

The future of `llms.txt` is uncertain but promising. It could fundamentally change how LLMs interact with the web, aligning websites with the AI-driven digital landscape. Companies like Ambiscale offer tailored solutions, as seen on [ambiscale.com](https://ambiscale.com/blog/what-is-llms-txt-and-why-does-your-website-need-it-in-the-ai-era/), suggesting a market for professional implementation.

Its evolution will depend on LLM advancements, community adoption, and potential standardization by web authorities. Fingers crossed.
