Below is an overview of each model in Alibaba’s Qwen 2.5 family of large language models, covering their technical specifications and intended uses.

## Qwen2.5 (Base Model)

Qwen2.5 is the foundation text model series in the Qwen family, offered in multiple sizes for general language tasks. It’s a dense, decoder-only Transformer-based LLM with improved capabilities over Qwen2.

- **Parameters & Architecture:** Available in **0.5B, 1.5B, 3B, 7B, 14B, 32B, and 72B** parameter variants ([GitHub - QwenLM/Qwen2.5: Qwen2.5 is the large language model series developed by Qwen team, Alibaba Cloud.](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5#:~:text=%2A%20Dense%2C%20easy,generate%20up%20to%208K%20tokens)). All are **decoder-only Transformer** models with enhancements like rotary positional embeddings (RoPE), SwiGLU activation, grouped-query attention (GQA), and RMSNorm ([Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct · Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct#:~:text=,tokens%20and%20generation%208192%20tokens)). These design choices make Qwen2.5 efficient and stable for long-form generation.
- **Context Window:** Supports an extended context up to **128,000 tokens** (full attention) for input, and can generate outputs over **8,000 tokens** long ([Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct · Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct#:~:text=,Vietnamese%2C%20Thai%2C%20Arabic%2C%20and%20more)). This large context window enables processing of very long documents or conversations without losing track of earlier content.
- **Supported Modalities:** **Text-only** (natural language). Qwen2.5 handles a wide range of textual inputs and outputs (including code or structured text as plain text) but does not natively process images, audio, or video.
- **Multilingual Support:** Yes. Pretrained on a massive corpus (~18 trillion tokens) including **29+ languages** (e.g. Chinese, English, French, Spanish, Arabic, etc.) ([GitHub - QwenLM/Qwen2.5: Qwen2.5 is the large language model series developed by Qwen team, Alibaba Cloud.](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5#:~:text=,Vietnamese%2C%20Thai%2C%20Arabic%2C%20and%20more)). It can understand and generate in many languages, with especially strong Chinese and English capabilities.
- **Function Calling / Tool Use:** Designed to produce **structured outputs (like JSON)** and follow instructions, which facilitates integration with tools and APIs ([GitHub - QwenLM/Qwen2.5: Qwen2.5 is the large language model series developed by Qwen team, Alibaba Cloud.](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5#:~:text=,generating%20structured%20outputs%20especially%20JSON)). While it doesn’t have a built-in API-calling mechanism, Qwen2.5 can be used with agent frameworks to perform tool-assisted actions ([GitHub - QwenLM/Qwen2.5: Qwen2.5 is the large language model series developed by Qwen team, Alibaba Cloud.](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5#:~:text=provides%20a%20wrapper%20around%20these,how%20to%20enable%20the%20support)) (for example, formatting answers for function calls or using external calculators in prompts).
- **License:** **Open-source** under Apache 2.0 ([Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct · Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct#:~:text=arxiv%3A%202407)). The model weights and checkpoints are freely available, allowing developers to use and fine-tune Qwen2.5 in their own applications.
- **Primary Use Cases:** Acts as a general-purpose LLM for **chatbots, content generation, Q&A, summarization, and knowledge assistants**. Qwen2.5’s strong instruction-following and structured output abilities make it suitable for building AI assistants that require reliable long-form generation and understanding of complex prompts (e.g. drafting documents, analyzing lengthy text inputs, or converting instructions to JSON responses).

## Qwen2.5-Omni (Omni-modal Model)

Qwen2.5-Omni is Qwen’s **flagship end-to-end multimodal model**, capable of perceiving and generating across text, vision, and audio modalities in real time. It introduces a novel “Thinker-Talker” architecture for simultaneous understanding and response generation.

- **Parameters & Architecture:** **7B parameters** (based on the Qwen2.5-7B backbone) ([Qwen](https://qwenlm.github.io/#:~:text=QWEN%20CHAT%20HUGGING%20FACE%20MODELSCOPE,documentation%20available%20in%20our%20Paper)) with a **“Thinker-Talker” dual architecture**. This design allows it to **process text, images, audio, and video inputs and produce text and speech outputs concurrently** ([Qwen/Qwen2.5-Omni-7B · Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Omni-7B#:~:text=Qwen2.5,responses%20in%20a%20streaming%20manner)). A custom position encoding called **TMRoPE (Time-aligned Multimodal RoPE)** is used to synchronize audio/video timelines ([Qwen/Qwen2.5-Omni-7B · Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Omni-7B#:~:text=,of%20video%20inputs%20with%20audio)), enabling alignment of spoken words with video frames.
- **Context Window:** Supports streaming interaction rather than a fixed token limit. It can handle **chunked, real-time inputs** (e.g. streaming audio/video) and generate responses on the fly ([Qwen/Qwen2.5-Omni-7B · Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Omni-7B#:~:text=video%20inputs%20with%20audio)). For pure text input, it inherits a large text context (tens of thousands of tokens, similar to Qwen2.5) to maintain long conversations.
- **Supported Modalities:** **Multimodal –** accepts **text, images, audio, and video** as input, and outputs both **text and synthesized speech** ([Qwen/Qwen2.5-Omni-7B · Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Omni-7B#:~:text=Qwen2.5,responses%20in%20a%20streaming%20manner)). For example, you can show it an image or speak a question, and it will understand and answer with spoken words and written text. It performs **real-time voice/video chat**, meaning it can listen via audio, watch video frames, and talk back continuously.
- **Multilingual Support:** Partially. It understands and generates text in multiple languages (inherited from Qwen2.5’s multilingual training). Its speech synthesis currently supports at least English (with selectable voice personas like “Chelsie” or “Ethan” for output) ([Qwen/Qwen2.5-Omni-7B · Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Omni-7B#:~:text=match%20at%20L601%20Users%20can,Chelsie)) and likely Chinese. This makes it capable of bilingual conversations, though voice output may be more natural in its primary language.
- **Function Calling / Tool Use:** Not focused on third-party tool use (its strength lies in direct multimodal interaction). However, it can **respond to spoken instructions and perform tasks like an AI assistant**, which could involve operating connected devices in a broader system. The Omni model’s real-time processing could be integrated into voice assistants or robotics, but there’s no explicit function-calling API beyond understanding commands.
- **License:** **Open-source** (Apache 2.0). Qwen2.5-Omni-7B is openly available on Hugging Face and Alibaba ModelScope ([Qwen](https://qwenlm.github.io/#:~:text=QWEN%20CHAT%20HUGGING%20FACE%20MODELSCOPE,documentation%20available%20in%20our%20Paper)), along with technical documentation ([Qwen](https://qwenlm.github.io/#:~:text=Designed%20for%20comprehensive%20multimodal%20perception%2C,documentation%20available%20in%20our%20Paper)). Developers can run it locally for research or integrate it into applications that need multimodal AI.
- **Primary Use Cases:** **Multimodal assistants and agents.** Qwen2.5-Omni is ideal for building AI that can **see, hear, and speak**. For example, it can power a virtual assistant that the user can talk to (speech recognition by the model), show pictures or videos to, and get spoken answers. Use cases include video conferencing assistants, interactive robots, customer service avatars, or any application requiring audiovisual understanding plus natural language dialog.

## Qwen2.5-VL (Vision-Language Model)

Qwen2.5-VL is a **vision-language** model series that extends Qwen2.5 with visual understanding. It combines a Vision Transformer encoder with the Qwen language decoder, enabling image and video comprehension alongside text generation. This model excels at analyzing visual content and describing or reasoning about it in text form.

- **Parameters & Architecture:** Available in **3B, 7B, and 72B** parameter versions ([Qwen2.5-VL](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/qwen2_5_vl#:~:text=Qwen2.5,capture%20and%20learn%20temporal%20dynamics)) (with an additional 32B instruct model released later ([Blog | Qwen](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/#:~:text=QWEN%20CHAT%20GITHUB%20HUGGING%20FACE,to%20the%20previously%20released%20Qwen2))). It integrates a high-resolution **ViT-based image encoder** with windowed attention for efficiency, feeding into the Qwen2.5 decoder. Innovations include **dynamic resolution & frame-rate handling** for video input and an upgraded **multi-resolution RoPE** for temporal sequences ([Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct · Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct#:~:text=,Rate%20Training%20for%20Video%20Understanding)). This allows Qwen2.5-VL to handle images of varying sizes and long videos by sampling frames, all while aligning time steps for video understanding.
- **Context Window:** Capable of **long video analysis** – the model can comprehend videos **over an hour long** by intelligently sampling frames and aligning them in time ([Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct · Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct#:~:text=%2A%20Being%20agentic%3A%20Qwen2.5,computer%20use%20and%20phone%20use)). For purely textual context, it supports a large token window (comparable to the base Qwen2.5’s tens of thousands of tokens). Additionally, it can process multiple images in one query or lengthy documents scanned into images, outputting consolidated results.
- **Supported Modalities:** **Visual and text modalities.** It accepts **images and videos as input**, along with accompanying text or prompts, and produces **textual outputs** ([Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct · Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct#:~:text=%2A%20Understand%20things%20visually%3A%20Qwen2.5,graphics%2C%20and%20layouts%20within%20images)) ([Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct · Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct#:~:text=,pinpointing%20the%20relevant%20video%20segments)). Outputs can be descriptive (e.g. captioning an image), analytical (answering questions about an image/chart), or even **structured data** like bounding box coordinates in JSON ([Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct · Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct#:~:text=,outputs%20for%20coordinates%20and%20attributes)). (The model can, for instance, draw boxes around objects in an image and return their pixel coordinates as JSON.)
- **Multilingual Support:** Yes. Qwen2.5-VL inherits multilingual understanding from its text backbone. It can describe images or answer visual questions in **English or Chinese** (and possibly other languages), depending on the prompt language. It is trained on image captions, OCR data, and visual information in multiple languages ([Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct · Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct#:~:text=%2A%20Understand%20things%20visually%3A%20Qwen2.5,graphics%2C%20and%20layouts%20within%20images)), enabling broad usage (for example, reading text within images in various languages).
- **Function Calling / Tool Use:** **Advanced tool integration capabilities.** Qwen2.5-VL can act as a **“visual agent”**, meaning it can reason about an image and decide to invoke tools or APIs based on the content ([Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct · Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct#:~:text=capable%20of%20analyzing%20texts%2C%20charts%2C,graphics%2C%20and%20layouts%20within%20images)). For example, it might see a user interface screenshot and generate actions to click buttons (it was designed to **direct computer or phone use tools** in experiments). It natively outputs **structured results for vision tasks** – e.g. JSON with detected objects or parsed forms ([Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct · Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct#:~:text=,outputs%20for%20coordinates%20and%20attributes)) – which developers can directly use in applications. These features enable complex pipelines like reading and populating forms, data extraction from invoices, or controlling UI elements based on visual input.
- **License:** **Open-source (Apache 2.0)**. Alibaba has released multiple Qwen2.5-VL checkpoints for research and commercial use ([Blog | Qwen](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/#:~:text=QWEN%20CHAT%20GITHUB%20HUGGING%20FACE,to%20the%20previously%20released%20Qwen2)). The 32B vision-instruct model and others are available on Hugging Face under Apache-2.0, making it one of the most capable open multimodal models in its class.
- **Primary Use Cases:** **Image and video understanding tasks.** Qwen2.5-VL can power applications like **image captioning, visual question answering, OCR and document analysis, chart understanding, and surveillance video analysis**. For example, it could be used in a document-processing system to read and output structured data from scanned forms, or in an educational app that explains diagrams. It’s also suited for multimedia assistants that need to discuss visual content (e.g., a chatbot that you can show a diagram or photograph and ask questions about it).

## Qwen2.5-Coder (Code Specialist Model)

Qwen2.5-Coder is a specialization of Qwen2.5 aimed at programming tasks. It’s fine-tuned on extensive code corpora to excel in code generation, completion, and reasoning. This model is intended to serve as a coding assistant, providing high accuracy in multiple programming languages.

- **Parameters & Architecture:** Comes in **1.5B and 7B** parameter models (both base and instruction-tuned variants) ([Qwen2.5-Coder Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/html/2409.12186v1#:~:text=Building%20upon%20our%20previous%20work%2C,committed%20to%20fostering%20research%20and)) ([Qwen2.5-Coder Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/html/2409.12186v1#:~:text=tasks,Coder%20models%20to%20the)). The architecture is the same decoder-only Transformer as Qwen2.5, with 28 layers and identical vocabulary/tokenizer ([Qwen2.5-Coder Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/html/2409.12186v1#:~:text=parameters,value%20heads)), but trained heavily on code. Despite the relatively smaller size, Qwen2.5-Coder achieves top-tier code performance due to focused training on code data and an optimized instruction set for coding tasks ([Qwen2.5-Coder Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/html/2409.12186v1#:~:text=Building%20upon%20our%20previous%20work%2C,Coder%20models%20to%20the)).
- **Context Window:** Inherits a **long context** from Qwen2.5 – capable of handling very long code files or chat histories. It supports context lengths on the order of **10^4 tokens (tens of thousands)**, allowing it to consider large code bases or multiple files when generating or refactoring code ([Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct · Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct#:~:text=,Vietnamese%2C%20Thai%2C%20Arabic%2C%20and%20more)). This enables use cases like providing assistance on a lengthy function or across several classes in one go.
- **Supported Modalities:** **Text (Code).** Qwen2.5-Coder is specialized for programming text – it understands code in many languages, error messages, and code-related natural language prompts. It’s adept at writing **source code, pseudo-code, and inline documentation**, but it does not process non-textual modalities.
- **Multilingual Support:** Focused on programming languages rather than human languages. It was trained on code spanning **dozens of programming languages** (covering mainstream ones like Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, etc.) and can handle multi-language codebases ([Qwen2.5-Coder Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/html/2409.12186v1#:~:text=across%20multiple%20programming%20languages%20to,choose%20to%20evaluate%20eight%20mainstream)). For natural language prompts, it primarily supports **English (and Chinese)** instructions about coding, since those are common in training data. It can respond to prompts or questions about code in either language, and produce comments or explanations bilingually if required.
- **Function Calling / Tool Use:** Qwen2.5-Coder does not have an explicit tool API, but it acts as a **coding assistant** that can be integrated into developer tools. For example, it can be plugged into an IDE for autocompletion or used in an agent that runs code tests. It has been tuned to follow instructions like “write a function to do X” or “fix this error,” effectively performing “function calling” by generating the requested function or using pseudo-code to describe API calls. Additionally, it can output test cases or pseudo-REPL interactions if prompted, aiding debugging.
- **License:** **Open-source (Apache 2.0)** – the Qwen2.5-Coder models (1.5B & 7B, base and instruct) are openly released ([Qwen2.5-Coder Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/html/2409.12186v1#:~:text=Building%20upon%20our%20previous%20work%2C,committed%20to%20fostering%20research%20and)). This allows developers to self-host the model for coding assistance or fine-tune it further on domain-specific code (e.g., a particular framework).
- **Primary Use Cases:** **Programming assistance.** Ideal for **auto-completing code, generating new functions or classes, explaining code snippets, translating code between languages**, and even basic mathematical reasoning related to coding ([Qwen2.5-Coder Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/html/2409.12186v1#:~:text=performance%20in%20coding%20tasks%20at,Coder%20models%20to%20the)). Developers can use Qwen2.5-Coder in chat mode to get step-by-step help with algorithms or in completion mode to suggest the next lines in a program. It’s well-suited for integration into code editors, AI pair programming tools, or coding Q&A bots (answering questions about how to implement something or fix a bug).

## Qwen2.5-Math (Mathematical Reasoning Model)

Qwen2.5-Math is a domain-specific variant of Qwen tailored for **mathematics problem solving**. It leverages additional training on math datasets and tools to excel at complex calculations, algebra, and reasoning through math word problems in a step-by-step manner.

- **Parameters & Architecture:** Provided in **1.5B, 7B, and 72B** parameter sizes ([GitHub - QwenLM/Qwen2.5-Math: A series of math-specific large language models of our Qwen2 series.](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-Math#:~:text=A%20month%20ago%2C%20we%20released,72B)), each with a base and an instruction-tuned version ([GitHub - QwenLM/Qwen2.5-Math: A series of math-specific large language models of our Qwen2 series.](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-Math#:~:text=it%20and%20open,72B)). The architecture is the Qwen2.5 Transformer, but pretrained further on a large math-specific corpus and fine-tuned to follow mathematical problem-solving instructions. Notably, a **reward model (72B)** was also trained for math, indicating reinforcement learning was used to refine its solutions ([GitHub - QwenLM/Qwen2.5-Math: A series of math-specific large language models of our Qwen2 series.](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-Math#:~:text=it%20and%20open,72B)). Despite smaller model sizes (1.5B and 7B) in the lineup, Qwen2.5-Math demonstrates strong specialized performance by focusing on the “expertise” of math.
- **Context Window:** Supports long-form math reasoning with a context similar to Qwen2.5’s (up to ~128K tokens if needed). It can ingest lengthy problem statements or even multiple problems at once. More practically, the model is designed to output multi-step derivations (proofs, solutions) that can easily run into thousands of tokens. It reliably handles those long chains of thought without losing coherence. For most math tasks, the typical context (a problem and step-by-step solution) will fit well within its extensive window.
- **Supported Modalities:** **Textual math problems and solutions.** Input can include plain text math problems (with LaTeX or Unicode math symbols) and it outputs text explanations, proofs, or answers. It does **not support images** of equations or graphs natively (those would require the VL model), focusing instead on symbolic and word formulations of math tasks.
- **Multilingual Support:** Primarily **English and Chinese** mathematical queries ([GitHub - QwenLM/Qwen2.5-Math: A series of math-specific large language models of our Qwen2 series.](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-Math#:~:text=Unlike%20Qwen2,English%20mathematics%20benchmarks%20with%20CoT)). Qwen2.5-Math was explicitly expanded from its predecessor to handle math in Chinese as well as English, given many benchmark datasets in both languages ([GitHub - QwenLM/Qwen2.5-Math: A series of math-specific large language models of our Qwen2 series.](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-Math#:~:text=Unlike%20Qwen2,English%20mathematics%20benchmarks%20with%20CoT)). It can likely tackle math problems posed in other languages to some extent (due to the multilingual nature of base Qwen), but it’s optimized for the two above. The model can output reasoning and answers in either language, which is valuable for educational contexts in different regions.
- **Function Calling / Tool Use:** **Yes – Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR).** Beyond just using “Chain-of-Thought” reasoning, Qwen2.5-Math can invoke tools like calculators or symbolic solvers as part of its reasoning process ([GitHub - QwenLM/Qwen2.5-Math: A series of math-specific large language models of our Qwen2 series.](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-Math#:~:text=Unlike%20Qwen2,English%20mathematics%20benchmarks%20with%20CoT)). In training, it learned to decide when to use an external tool (for example, calling a Python function to invert a matrix) and incorporate the result into its solution. This means the model is capable of augmenting its reasoning with precise computations, greatly improving accuracy for complex tasks (solving equations, integrals, etc.). Developers can enable this by intercepting special tool-use tokens or prompts – effectively, Qwen2.5-Math can hand off a sub-problem (like arithmetic) to an external calculator and then continue the reasoning with that result.
- **License:** **Open-source (Apache 2.0)**. The Qwen2.5-Math series (including the reward model and instruct models) has been open-sourced ([GitHub - QwenLM/Qwen2.5-Math: A series of math-specific large language models of our Qwen2 series.](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-Math#:~:text=A%20month%20ago%2C%20we%20released,72B)), allowing its use in educational software or research. Due to its focused nature, users are advised that it’s not a general model; it’s mainly intended for math problem solving ([GitHub - QwenLM/Qwen2.5-Math: A series of math-specific large language models of our Qwen2 series.](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-Math#:~:text=%3E%20Qwen2.5,of%20models%20for%20other%20tasks)).
- **Primary Use Cases:** **Mathematical problem solving and tutoring.** Qwen2.5-Math is ideal for systems that need to solve math contest problems, assist students with homework (showing steps), or verify calculations. Example use cases: a math homework helper chatbot that can explain solutions, an automated theorem prover assistant (for algebra, calculus, etc.), or any application that requires high-confidence math reasoning (engineering calculations, finance modeling, etc.). Its ability to show step-by-step solutions and use calculation tools makes it robust for any scenario where showing the work is as important as the final answer.

## Qwen2.5-Max (Mixture-of-Experts Flagship Model)

Qwen2.5-Max is the **large-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** version of Qwen, representing Alibaba’s most advanced LLM in the Qwen 2.5 generation. It scales the model capacity dramatically (hundreds of billions of parameters) while using experts to keep inference efficient. Qwen2.5-Max is positioned to compete with top-tier models like GPT-4-class systems in capability.

- **Parameters & Architecture:** Approximately **325 billion parameters** in a Mixture-of-Experts architecture ([Qwen2.5-Max: Advancing Large-Scale Mixture-of-Expert Models](https://wandb.ai/byyoung3/ml-news/reports/Qwen2-5-Max-Advancing-Large-Scale-Mixture-of-Expert-Models---VmlldzoxMTEyMjUyNg#:~:text=Qwen2.5,on%20over%2020%20trillion%20tokens)). Instead of a single massive dense model, Qwen2.5-Max is composed of many expert sub-models; at runtime only a subset of these “experts” activate per token, which greatly improves compute efficiency ([Alibaba’s Qwen2.5-Max challenges U.S. tech giants, reshapes enterprise AI | VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/ai/alibabas-qwen2-5-max-challenges-u-s-tech-giants-reshapes-enterprise-ai/#:~:text=For%20CIOs%20and%20technical%20leaders%2C,traditional%20large%20language%20model%20deployments)). It was pretrained on **over 20 trillion tokens** of data ([Alibaba’s Qwen2.5-Max challenges U.S. tech giants, reshapes enterprise AI | VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/ai/alibabas-qwen2-5-max-challenges-u-s-tech-giants-reshapes-enterprise-ai/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20have%20been%20building%20Qwen2.5,computational%20resources%20than%20traditional%20approaches)), ensuring broad and deep knowledge. The architecture includes the same Transformer decoder backbone with added gating networks to route queries to different expert blocks. This MoE design allows Qwen2.5-Max to achieve superior performance without a proportional increase in inference cost, reportedly reducing required GPU resources by **40–60% compared to a dense model of similar size** ([Alibaba’s Qwen2.5-Max challenges U.S. tech giants, reshapes enterprise AI | VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/ai/alibabas-qwen2-5-max-challenges-u-s-tech-giants-reshapes-enterprise-ai/#:~:text=For%20CIOs%20and%20technical%20leaders%2C,traditional%20large%20language%20model%20deployments)).
- **Context Window:** **32,768 tokens (32k) context length** for full attention ([
  Models - Alibaba Cloud Model Studio - Alibaba Cloud Documentation Center

](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/model-studio/models#:~:text=Maximum%20context)). Qwen2.5-Max supports very long input prompts out-of-the-box, sufficient for lengthy documents or multi-turn dialogues. (It leverages the same positional encoding innovations as Qwen2.5 to maintain coherence over long contexts.) There may be internal support for even longer contexts via specialized inference frameworks, but 32k is the standard. This large window allows it to handle complex inputs, such as a lengthy legal contract or multiple code files, all at once.

- **Supported Modalities:** **Text** (natural language, code, etc.). Qwen2.5-Max does not have built-in multimodal encoders – it focuses on text and everything that can be encoded as text. It excels at a wide range of text tasks: from open-domain knowledge queries to coding, reasoning, and creative writing. (For vision or audio, it would rely on connected models like Qwen-VL or Omni feeding it descriptions.)
- **Multilingual Support:** Yes. As a superset of Qwen2.5’s training, it is fluent in **English, Chinese, and many other languages**, and able to perform translation or cross-lingual tasks. Given the expanded training data, Qwen2.5-Max likely further improved on low-resource languages as well. It’s designed to serve global users, so it maintains Qwen’s multilingual breadth. All interface and documentation point to it being at least as capable as Qwen2.5 in the 29+ supported languages.
- **Function Calling / Tool Use:** Qwen2.5-Max inherits all the instruction-following and structured output capabilities of Qwen2.5, and with its greater capacity it can be even more **“agentic.”** It can produce well-formatted JSON, write code to call APIs, or follow complex tool-using prompts with higher reliability (owing to its scale). While there isn’t a separate function-calling interface exposed, its strong reasoning means it can be integrated as the brain of an AI agent. For instance, it could take a high-level request, break it down into steps, and interact with tools or databases via an orchestrating system. Its large scale also means it can remember and use a larger set of tool results or intermediate computations within its context window.
- **License:** **Proprietary (API access)**. Unlike smaller Qwen models, Qwen2.5-Max’s full weights are _not_ openly released. It is available through Alibaba Cloud’s API and services (e.g., Qwen Chat) ([Qwen2.5-Max: Exploring the Intelligence of Large-scale MoE Model | Qwen](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-max/#:~:text=with%20the%20recent%20release%20of,Max%20on%20Qwen%20Chat)). Enterprises can leverage it via cloud deployment, but they cannot download the model weights directly. (This approach is similar to other top-tier models where the provider offers it as a service for controlled access.)
- **Primary Use Cases:** **Enterprise-grade AI tasks and research.** With its high capacity and broad knowledge, Qwen2.5-Max is suited for **complex decision support, deep knowledge question answering, large-scale code generation, and any application requiring top-tier reasoning and creativity**. Enterprises might use it for business analytics (processing extensive reports and data), advanced chatbots with domain expertise, or as a core engine for AI services that demand the best quality (comparable to GPT-4). Its performance on benchmarks indicates state-of-the-art results in areas like knowledge exams, coding challenges, and analytical reasoning ([Alibaba’s Qwen2.5-Max challenges U.S. tech giants, reshapes enterprise AI | VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/ai/alibabas-qwen2-5-max-challenges-u-s-tech-giants-reshapes-enterprise-ai/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20have%20been%20building%20Qwen2.5,computational%20resources%20than%20traditional%20approaches)), making it a flagship model for pushing AI application frontiers.

## QVQ (Visual Reasoning Model – 72B Preview)

“QVQ” is a vision-language model series focused on **Visual Question Answering and reasoning with visual evidence**. It builds upon Qwen2.5-VL but emphasizes reasoning steps (“thinking”) about images and videos. The initial release was QVQ-72B-Preview, demonstrating the concept of a model that can not only describe an image but also reason about it to solve complex tasks.

- **Parameters & Architecture:** **72B parameters (dense)** for the QVQ-72B preview model ([QVQ - a Qwen Collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/Qwen/qvq-676448c820912236342b9888#:~:text=)). It uses the same architecture as Qwen2.5-VL-72B (ViT image encoder + Transformer decoder) as its foundation ([QVQ-Max - WTAI Navigation](https://wtai.cc/item/qvq-max#:~:text=QVQ,AI%27s%20capabilities%20in%20visual)). The key difference is in training: QVQ is fine-tuned with methodologies to improve visual reasoning, such as explicit chain-of-thought training on image-based problems. Essentially, it is a very large vision-language model that has been encouraged to “think out loud” about visual inputs, increasing its reasoning depth. The preview version was an exploratory model to identify and fix issues before the full release ([Blog | Qwen](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/#:~:text=QVQ)).
- **Context Window:** Similar to Qwen2.5-VL, it can handle **multiple images or lengthy videos** as input. The 72B preview inherits the ability to process **videos (multi-frame)** and large images. It also can carry on a multi-turn dialogue about an image, retaining context across a long series of Q&A rounds about that image. The text context (for dialogue/history) extends to thousands of tokens, while the visual context can include video sequences of significant length (minutes of video). This was crucial for enabling it to perform tasks like analyzing a video and answering high-level questions requiring understanding of temporal events.
- **Supported Modalities:** **Images, videos → text**. QVQ takes visual inputs (static pictures or video clips) and produces **textual answers and explanations**. Its hallmark is providing **detailed reasoning** in its output – for example, if asked a complex question about an image, QVQ will output a step-by-step thought process discussing the visual evidence before giving an answer. This improves transparency and accuracy for tasks like multi-step visual puzzles, chart analysis, or figuring out the answer to a question that requires looking at multiple elements in an image.
- **Multilingual Support:** Yes, to a degree. Since it’s based on Qwen-VL, it can understand prompts and provide answers in English or Chinese (and possibly other languages). The visual reasoning ability is language-agnostic, but expressing the reasoning and answer will be in the prompt’s language. The preview primarily demonstrated English Q&A about images. It’s safe to assume it can do bilingual visual reasoning (e.g., describing an image in Chinese and answering questions about it).
- **Function Calling / Tool Use:** The model itself doesn’t call external tools, but it heavily uses **“chain-of-thought” internally**, effectively a reasoning tool. When answering, QVQ might produce an explanation followed by an answer, which developers can parse if they want a rationale. This could be viewed as the model using a _reasoning tool_ (its own capabilities) to justify answers – hence the tagline “Think with Evidence.” There’s no evidence that QVQ directly controls external APIs, but it is structured to integrate with evaluation frameworks that require rationale (for instance, it could provide a reasoned solution to a visual math puzzle that could be checked by a separate calculator).
- **License:** **Open (preview release).** The QVQ-72B preview model weights were released for the community ([QVQ - a Qwen Collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/Qwen/qvq-676448c820912236342b9888#:~:text=)), under the same permissive license (Apache 2.0). This allowed researchers to try out the model’s visual reasoning capabilities on their own data. Future or final versions (see QVQ-Max) might follow the open model or API route, but the initial preview was openly accessible.
- **Primary Use Cases:** **Complex visual question answering and analysis.** QVQ is useful when simply describing an image is not enough – the task requires **logical inference based on the image/video**. Use cases include: solving high-level reasoning puzzles from images (e.g., interpreting a scientific graphic to answer a question), analyzing surveillance footage for specific events, answering multi-part questions about a medical image (where reasoning about the visual evidence is needed), or assisting with tasks like geometry problem-solving from diagrams. Essentially, QVQ can serve as a backend for any application that needs an AI to **look at images/videos and provide not just answers but the reasoning behind those answers**.

## QVQ-Max (Advanced Visual Reasoning Model)

QVQ-Max is the **next-generation visual reasoning model** succeeding the QVQ preview. It represents the first full release of the visual reasoning series, with significant improvements in accuracy, reasoning length, and possibly model architecture. QVQ-Max is designed to handle **complex multimodal problems with extended reasoning**, combining vision understanding with long, structured thought processes.

- **Parameters & Architecture:** Although exact details are proprietary, QVQ-Max is **based on Qwen2.5-VL at the 72B scale** (and potentially augmented similarly to Qwen2.5-Max) ([QVQ-Max - WTAI Navigation](https://wtai.cc/item/qvq-max#:~:text=QVQ,AI%27s%20capabilities%20in%20visual)) ([Alibaba Cloud Unveils New AI Models and Infrastructure Upgrades ...](https://sme.asia/alibaba-cloud-unveils-new-ai-models-and-infrastructure-upgrades-at-spring-launch-2025/#:~:text=...%20sme.asia%20%20QVQ,PAI)). It likely employs a Mixture-of-Experts or other scaling technique to improve upon the dense 72B model’s performance and efficiency (the phrasing “72B model – significantly enhancing scalability and efficiency” ([Alibaba Cloud Unveils New AI Models and Infrastructure Upgrades ...](https://sme.asia/alibaba-cloud-unveils-new-ai-models-and-infrastructure-upgrades-at-spring-launch-2025/#:~:text=...%20sme.asia%20%20QVQ,PAI)) suggests an MoE or highly optimized version). The architecture continues with a ViT image encoder + language model, but with refined training via SFT and RLHF specifically targeting visual tasks. The result is a model that can maintain a **lengthy chain-of-thought about visual inputs**, more so than its preview predecessor.
- **Context Window:** Extended for both visual and textual content. QVQ-Max can process **multiple images and long videos with ease**, pinpointing relevant segments as needed. It also has an expanded capacity to maintain very long dialogues or explanations – it can output very detailed rationales for a single question, or sustain a Q&A session about a video with many follow-up questions. Essentially, it’s built to **“think for a long time”** about what it sees, meaning it won’t cut off reasoning prematurely. This makes it suitable for tasks where an AI needs to analyze a lot of visual information and possibly cross-reference it with a lot of text (e.g. a page of math problems with diagrams).
- **Supported Modalities:** **Images, videos → text (with reasoning).** Same modality support as QVQ: visual inputs and textual outputs. However, QVQ-Max pushes the output further by often producing a **step-by-step reasoning (`chain-of-thought`) as part of its answer** ([Alibaba Cloud Strengthens AI Capabilities with Innovations for International Customers - Alibaba Cloud Community](https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/alibaba-cloud-strengthens-ai-capabilities-with-innovations-for-international-customers_602126#:~:text=QwQ,thought%20output)). For example, given a complex diagram and a question, QVQ-Max might generate a structured explanation of how it interprets each part of the diagram, what it infers, and finally the answer. This is extremely valuable for transparency in domains like medicine or finance (where you want to know _why_ the model gave a certain answer about an image).
- **Multilingual Support:** Yes. Just like QVQ, it can discuss visual content in multiple languages. QVQ-Max being a more advanced model, likely underwent further training on bilingual multimodal data. The chain-of-thought outputs could thus be in English, Chinese, or any language the prompt is given in, making it globally applicable for visual analysis tasks.
- **Function Calling / Tool Use:** QVQ-Max focuses on **“extended reasoning”** rather than direct tool use ([Alibaba Cloud Strengthens AI Capabilities with Innovations for International Customers - Alibaba Cloud Community](https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/alibaba-cloud-strengthens-ai-capabilities-with-innovations-for-international-customers_602126#:~:text=QwQ,thought%20output)). Its strength is that it reduces the need for external tools by reasoning internally. That said, it can interface with tools similarly to Qwen2.5-VL if programmed to (for example, it could decide to use a calculator for a sub-problem in an image-based math question, or it could output coordinates to be used by a downstream drawing tool). Essentially, it provides the brains and rationale, and developers can pair it with tools if needed. The model’s detailed output can be seen as it providing a plan or evidence that another system could act on (“think with evidence” means it gives evidence that a downstream system or user can use to verify or execute actions).
- **License:** **Proprietary (cloud service).** As of its release, QVQ-Max is offered via Alibaba Cloud’s platform and Qwen Chat for international users ([Alibaba Cloud Strengthens AI Capabilities with Innovations for International Customers - Alibaba Cloud Community](https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/alibaba-cloud-strengthens-ai-capabilities-with-innovations-for-international-customers_602126#:~:text=Alibaba%20Cloud%20announced%20new%20offerings,7b)) ([Alibaba Cloud Strengthens AI Capabilities with Innovations for International Customers - Alibaba Cloud Community](https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/alibaba-cloud-strengthens-ai-capabilities-with-innovations-for-international-customers_602126#:~:text=QwQ,thought%20output)). The weights have not been open-sourced yet; instead, users access it through API endpoints or the Qwen Chat interface. (Alibaba may choose to open-source a version in the future, but the initial emphasis is on providing it as a service due to its complexity and size.)
- **Primary Use Cases:** **Expert-level visual problem solving.** QVQ-Max is aimed at scenarios where an AI must **analyze visual data deeply and draw conclusions or solve problems that require several reasoning steps**. For instance, in healthcare it could examine a series of X-rays or slides and reason about disease progression. In video analytics, it could watch a lengthy security video and answer questions about suspicious activities with justification. In education, it might solve and explain geometry problems that involve diagrams. Essentially, QVQ-Max is suited for any application needing **multimodal reasoning with a high degree of confidence and explainability**, thanks to its ability to articulate the evidence it used from the visuals.

## QwQ (Reinforced Reasoning Model)

“QwQ” (Qwen with Questions) is a specialized model in the Qwen family focusing on **improving reasoning via reinforcement learning**. Based on the 32B Qwen2.5 model, QwQ underwent intensive training (including multi-stage RL) to enhance its performance on challenging reasoning tasks across domains like math and coding ([
Models - Alibaba Cloud Model Studio - Alibaba Cloud Documentation Center

](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/model-studio/models#:~:text=QwQ)) ([
Models - Alibaba Cloud Model Studio - Alibaba Cloud Documentation Center

](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/model-studio/models#:~:text=QwQ%20reasoning%20model%2C%20trained%20based,R1.%20Usage%20instructions)). The result is a model that can tackle complex questions with deeper “thinking” and better accuracy than the base model.

- **Parameters & Architecture:** **32B parameters**, using the standard dense Qwen2.5 architecture at that size. QwQ is essentially Qwen2.5-32B that has been further fine-tuned with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and other techniques to optimize its reasoning ability ([Blog | Qwen](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/#:~:text=QwQ,Reinforcement%20Learning)). The architecture wasn’t modified, but the training process was – leveraging custom datasets (including challenging questions and step-by-step solutions) and RL reward signals. This makes QwQ-32B a distilled “expert reasoner” while keeping the inference footprint manageable.
- **Context Window:** Inherits the large context of Qwen2.5-32B, so it can handle ~32K tokens of conversation or problem statement. This is useful because complex questions often come with lots of context (or require the model to remember previous discussion). QwQ can maintain lengthy chains of thought within one session. Its long context also enables it to work through multi-part problems or reference earlier clues in a puzzle-riddle format. Essentially, it can think through a problem as long as needed (within the limits of Qwen’s extended context).
- **Supported Modalities:** **Text (multi-domain).** QwQ deals with **any text-based reasoning**, including **logical puzzles, mathematical word problems, code reasoning, and complex Q&A**. It does not have multimodal input; however, it can reason about descriptions of images or data given in text form. The training specifically boosted its performance on math (e.g. competition problems) and coding challenges, so it’s adept in those formats, but it remains a general text model (you can ask it common sense or analytical questions on any topic).
- **Multilingual Support:** **Yes (bilingual).** Since it’s built on Qwen2.5, QwQ understands both English and Chinese. The reinforcement learning data likely included mostly English challenging tasks (many benchmarks like AIME, LiveCodeBench are English) ([
  Models - Alibaba Cloud Model Studio - Alibaba Cloud Documentation Center

](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/model-studio/models#:~:text=QwQ%20reasoning%20model%2C%20trained%20based,R1)), but the model retains Chinese ability too. So it can perform reasoning in Chinese prompts as well, though its absolute prowess has been measured primarily on English benchmarks. In practice, it can be used for complex question answering in either language, making it useful in a multilingual context.

- **Function Calling / Tool Use:** QwQ does not introduce new tool-use capabilities beyond what Qwen2.5 can do; the focus is on **internal reasoning improvement**. It will generate more rigorous and structured reasoning when answering, which a developer could parse or use (for instance, it might format an answer with an argument, which could be considered a “proof” or explanation). If integrated into an agent, QwQ’s stronger reasoning may translate to better decisions about when to invoke tools (though that logic is external to the model). In short, it’s not about calling functions, but about breaking down problems – it “calls” on its internal logic more effectively.
- **License:** **Open-source (Apache 2.0)**. The QwQ-32B model and even a preview version were released openly ([QwQ - a Qwen Collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/Qwen/qwq-674762b79b75eac01735070a#:~:text=Running%20529%20529%20QwQ%2032B,)). This is somewhat unusual for a reinforcement-learned model (since RLHF models are often kept proprietary), but Alibaba made it available to allow the community to benefit from its reasoning advancements. It can be used or fine-tuned further, with the caution that it’s specialized for reasoning tasks.
- **Primary Use Cases:** **Hard question answering and AI research.** QwQ is ideal wherever you need an AI to **solve tough problems or riddles step by step**, such as competition math problems (e.g. AMC/AIME-level questions), tricky logic puzzles, or multi-step inference questions (like those on academic exams). It’s also valuable in coding interviews or competitive programming help, where it needs to reason through the solution before writing code. Researchers might use QwQ as a starting point to build even stronger reasoners or to study how reinforcement learning can improve logical reasoning in language models. In applications, QwQ could be the “brain” of a chatbot that specializes in **tutoring** (since it can explain answers better) or an expert system that verifies answers by reasoning (for example, double-checking an answer with a detailed argument).
