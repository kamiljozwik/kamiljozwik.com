Qwen represents Alibaba Cloud's foundational AI model initiative. Launched initially in April 2023, Qwen isn't a single model but a comprehensive suite of LLMs designed to tackle a diverse range of tasks, from natural language understanding and generation to code creation and even processing visual and auditory information.

Built upon the proven [transformer architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXiruGOCn9s), all Qwen models benefit from pre-training on vast multilingual and multimodal datasets. They are further refined using high-quality data and alignment techniques, making them adept at following human instructions.

A significant advantage for developers is Alibaba's commitment to open source. Many Qwen models are released under the permissive **Apache 2.0 license**, readily available on platforms like [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Qwen). This open approach allows developers to experiment, customize, and deploy these powerful models locally or within their own infrastructure, complementing the API access provided via Alibaba Cloud.

_(Note: Early models like Qwen-7B/14B released in 2023 laid the groundwork, sometimes referred to as "Qwen-1". This guide focuses on the more recent and capable iterations.)_

## The core text engines: Qwen-1.5 and Qwen-2.5

At the heart of the Qwen family lie the general-purpose language models designed for text-based tasks such as question answering, content creation, summarization, reasoning, and dialogue. Alibaba has continuously iterated on these, leading to significant generational improvements.

### Qwen-1.5: the first leap forward

Released in early 2024, [Qwen-1.5](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen1.5/) marked a substantial upgrade over the initial models. Key enhancements included:

- **Improved alignment:** Better adherence to human instructions and preferences.
- **Extended context:** Larger context window of up to **32,768 tokens** across all model sizes.
- **Wide range of sizes:** Open-sourced [models](https://huggingface.co/collections/Qwen/qwen15-65c0a2f577b1ecb76d786524) ranging from a nimble 0.5B parameters up to a powerful 110B parameters (including 1.8B, 4B, 7B, 14B, 32B, 72B).
- **Developer-friendly formats:** Availability of quantized versions (`GPTQ`, `AWQ`, `GGUF`) to reduce memory footprint and run on less powerful hardware.
- **Multilingual:** Strong performance in Chinese and English, with support for other languages.

### Qwen-2.5: The current State-of-the-Art

Announced in late 2024, [Qwen-2.5](https://huggingface.co/collections/Qwen/qwen25-66e81a666513e518adb90d9e) represents the latest generation, pushing the boundaries even further:

- **Enhanced architecture:** Continues as a family of dense, decoder-only LLMs.
- **Refined sizes:** Offers sizes including 0.5B, 1.5B, 3B, 7B, 14B, 32B, and 72B, providing more granular choices for performance vs. resource trade-offs.
- **Massive training data:** Trained on an updated dataset of up to 18 trillion tokens.
- **Instruction following:** Improved ability to understand and execute complex user prompts.
- **Longer context:** Context window of up to **128,000 tokens**.
- **Structured data handling:** Better proficiency in understanding prompts requesting, and generating structured formats like `JSON`.
- **Expanded multilingualism:** Supports over **29 languages**, including major European and Asian languages.

Like its predecessor, Qwen-2.5 is open-sourced (Apache 2.0) with base and instruction-tuned versions for each size.

## Qwen-Chat

While the base Qwen models possess broad language understanding, the **Qwen-Chat** variants are specifically optimized for **dialogue and instruction following**. These models undergo additional fine-tuning using techniques like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on conversational data and alignment methods such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) or Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).

This tuning process results in models that are better behaved, safer, and more natural in interactive settings. For every base model size in the Qwen-1.5 and Qwen-2.5 series, there is a corresponding Qwen-Chat variant (e.g., Qwen-7B-Chat, Qwen2.5-72B-Chat).

**Key characteristics of Qwen-Chat models:**

- **Optimized for Interaction:** Designed for building chatbots, virtual assistants, and Q&A systems.
- **Instruction Adherence:** Pre-trained to understand and follow user commands effectively.
- **Contextual Memory:** Leverage the same long context windows as their base models (32K for Qwen-1.5, 128K for Qwen-2.5) to maintain coherence in multi-turn conversations.
- **Multilingual Dialogue:** Capable of conversing fluently in multiple languages.
- **Open Source:** Allows for local deployment, customization, and fine-tuning on specific conversational domains.

Qwen-Chat models provide a ready-to-use foundation for creating engaging and helpful conversational AI applications.

## Connecting to the World - Function Calling and Tool Use

A powerful capability embedded within Qwen models, especially the Chat variants, is **function calling**. This isn't a separate model but rather the ability of the LLM to interact with external systems, tools, and APIs in a structured manner.

Instead of just generating text, the model can output a structured format (typically JSON) indicating its intent to call a specific function with certain arguments. Your application can then parse this output, execute the corresponding function (e.g., query a database, call a weather API, perform a calculation), and feed the result back to the model to inform its final response.

Qwen models, particularly Qwen-2.5, have been trained to reliably generate these structured outputs, following specific prompting formats based on paradigms like ReAct (Reason+Act).

**How developers can leverage this:**

1.  **Open-Source Implementation:** Use the open Qwen models with documented prompt templates to trigger function-call outputs within your own application logic, often facilitated by frameworks like LangChain.
2.  **Alibaba Cloud API:** Utilize Alibaba's hosted Qwen API, which offers built-in, OpenAI-compatible function calling support, simplifying integration.

Function calling transforms the LLM from a text generator into an intelligent agent capable of taking actions, making AI applications significantly more practical and powerful.

## Specializing the Intelligence - Domain-Specific Models

Beyond general language tasks, the Qwen family includes variants fine-tuned for specific domains:

**Qwen-Coder: Your AI Pair Programmer**

## FULL

The **Qwen** model family (short for _Tongyi Qianwen_, Alibaba’s foundational AI model initiative) is a suite of large language models (LLMs) developed by Alibaba Cloud’s Qwen Team. These models are designed to excel across a range of AI tasks – from natural language understanding and generation to coding assistance, and even multimodal tasks involving vision and audio. Since its initial beta release in April 2023, Qwen has evolved into a comprehensive collection of models, each tailored to specific challenges in AI ([Qwen Models: Alibaba’s Next-Generation AI Family for Text, Vision, and Beyond](https://www.inferless.com/learn/the-ultimate-guide-to-qwen-model#:~:text=The%20Qwen%20model%20series%2C%20developed,natural%20language%20processing%20and%20understanding)). All Qwen models share a common transformer-based architecture and have been pre-trained on extensive multilingual and multimodal datasets, then refined with high-quality data and alignment techniques to better follow human instructions ([Qwen Models: Alibaba’s Next-Generation AI Family for Text, Vision, and Beyond](https://www.inferless.com/learn/the-ultimate-guide-to-qwen-model#:~:text=Qwen%2C%20also%20known%20as%20Tongyi,world%20applications)). Importantly, Alibaba has open-sourced many Qwen models under the Apache 2.0 license, making them accessible to developers via platforms like Hugging Face and ModelScope, as well as through Alibaba Cloud’s API services. This article introduces the most relevant Qwen variants, explaining their purposes, key features, and how developers can use them in applications.

_(Predecessors:_ Alibaba’s first Qwen models, such as **Qwen-7B** and **Qwen-14B** released in mid-2023, established the foundation. They demonstrated strong performance on language tasks and supported both Chinese and English, with up to 8K token context windows. These early models are occasionally referred to as “Qwen-1” series, and laid the groundwork for subsequent improved versions. We will focus on the newer iterations below, mentioning earlier versions only briefly.)\*

## General Language Models: Qwen-1.5 and Qwen-2.5 Series

**Qwen**’s core models are large language models intended for general-purpose **text-based tasks** like open-ended question answering, content generation, reasoning, and dialogue. Alibaba has iterated on these base models, with **Qwen-1.5** being the first major improved generation and **Qwen-2.5** the latest as of 2024–2025. These models serve as the backbone for many specialized Qwen variants.

- **Qwen-1.5 (First-Generation Improvements):** Released in early 2024, Qwen1.5 was an enhanced version of the initial Qwen models. It introduced substantial improvements in alignment with human preferences and multilingual capability, and crucially added support for **longer context lengths (up to 32,768 tokens)** across all model sizes ([Introducing Qwen1.5 | Qwen](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen1.5/#:~:text=This%20release%20brings%20substantial%20improvements,small%20stride%20toward%20our%20objective)). Qwen1.5 models were open-sourced in a wide range of sizes – from a tiny 0.5B parameter model up to a massive 110B parameters – including 1.8B, 4B, 7B, 14B, 32B, and 72B in between ([Introducing Qwen1.5 | Qwen](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen1.5/#:~:text=With%20Qwen1.5%2C%20we%20are%20open,4.37.0%60%20without%20needing%20%60trust_remote_code)) ([Qwen Models: Alibaba’s Next-Generation AI Family for Text, Vision, and Beyond](https://www.inferless.com/learn/the-ultimate-guide-to-qwen-model#:~:text=Then%2C%20the%20Qwen,AI%20systems%20communicate%20with%20users)). Each size has a base model (pre-trained on large text corpora) and a chat-tuned variant. Despite being large, Qwen1.5 was made developer-friendly: Alibaba provided 4-bit and 8-bit quantized versions (GPTQ, AWQ, GGUF formats) to facilitate running the models on commodity hardware ([Introducing Qwen1.5 | Qwen](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen1.5/#:~:text=With%20Qwen1.5%2C%20we%20are%20open,4.37.0%60%20without%20needing%20%60trust_remote_code)). All Qwen1.5 models support **multi-language** understanding and generation (strong in Chinese and English, with improved support for many others) and were trained or fine-tuned to follow instructions more reliably. They are available under an open-source license (Apache 2.0) on repositories like Hugging Face and ModelScope, meaning developers can download and deploy them locally. For instance, the smaller Qwen1.5 variants (0.5B–7B) can run on a single GPU (12–16 GB VRAM), while the larger ones (14B+) may require a multi-GPU setup or high-memory accelerators (or using the provided quantized models for reduced memory footprint). The Qwen1.5 release marked a step toward “good” aligned models that developers could fine-tune further or integrate into applications easily ([Introducing Qwen1.5 | Qwen](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen1.5/#:~:text=This%20release%20brings%20substantial%20improvements,small%20stride%20toward%20our%20objective)).

- **Qwen-2.5 (Latest Generation):** Announced in late 2024, Qwen-2.5 is the current state-of-the-art generation of Qwen models. Like its predecessor, Qwen2.5 is a family of **dense, decoder-only** LLMs, released in multiple parameter sizes – including **0.5B, 1.5B, 3B, 7B, 14B, 32B, and 72B** – with both base (pretrained) and _instruct-tuned_ variants ([GitHub - QwenLM/Qwen2.5: Qwen2.5 is the large language model series developed by Qwen team, Alibaba Cloud.](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5#:~:text=%2A%20Dense%2C%20easy,generate%20up%20to%208K%20tokens)) ([GitHub - QwenLM/Qwen2.5: Qwen2.5 is the large language model series developed by Qwen team, Alibaba Cloud.](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5#:~:text=News)). The introduction of intermediate sizes like 3B and 32B gives developers more flexibility to balance performance and resource constraints. Qwen-2.5 models were trained on an updated large-scale dataset of up to 18 trillion tokens, covering a wide range of domains and languages, which significantly boosted their capabilities in various areas. Notably, Qwen2.5 made strides in **instruction-following** (it’s better at understanding user prompts and complying with them) and in generating well-structured, extended outputs. These models can produce very **long responses (well beyond 8K tokens)** and handle ultra-long inputs thanks to an impressive **context window of up to 128K tokens** ([GitHub - QwenLM/Qwen2.5: Qwen2.5 is the large language model series developed by Qwen team, Alibaba Cloud.](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5#:~:text=,Vietnamese%2C%20Thai%2C%20Arabic%2C%20and%20more)). This very long context support means Qwen2.5 can be used for tasks like lengthy document analysis or multi-turn conversations without losing earlier context. Qwen2.5 also improved at understanding and generating **structured data formats**, such as tables or JSON outputs ([GitHub - QwenLM/Qwen2.5: Qwen2.5 is the large language model series developed by Qwen team, Alibaba Cloud.](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5#:~:text=,29%20languages%2C%20including%20Chinese%2C%20English)). This makes it adept at tasks like working with data or integrating with tools (more on function calling below). In terms of **multilingual** ability, Qwen-2.5 supports over **29 languages**, including Chinese, English, French, Spanish, German, Portuguese, Italian, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Thai, and many others ([GitHub - QwenLM/Qwen2.5: Qwen2.5 is the large language model series developed by Qwen team, Alibaba Cloud.](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5#:~:text=implementation%20and%20condition,Vietnamese%2C%20Thai%2C%20Arabic%2C%20and%20more)). This broad language support is valuable for developers building international applications. Like earlier Qwens, Qwen2.5 is open-sourced (Apache 2.0) and available on Hugging Face/ModelScope ([GitHub - QwenLM/Qwen2.5: Qwen2.5 is the large language model series developed by Qwen team, Alibaba Cloud.](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5#:~:text=Visit%20our%20Hugging%20Face%20or,find%20all%20you%20need%21%20Enjoy)). All sizes of Qwen2.5 can be used locally; smaller models (up to 7B or 14B) are feasible on a single modern GPU, while the largest 72B model may require multi-GPU or TPU setups (or optimization techniques like model quantization or offloading to CPU memory). The Qwen team has also integrated Qwen2.5 support into popular inference frameworks (Transformers, vLLM, Text Generation Inference, etc.), so developers can deploy it efficiently in production. Overall, Qwen-2.5 represents Alibaba’s latest general-purpose LLM and is a strong option when you need an open, long-context model for tasks like summarization, content generation, reasoning, and multi-language chat.

## Qwen-Chat: Conversational and Instruction-Tuned Models

**Qwen-Chat** refers to the instruction-tuned conversational variants of the Qwen base models. These are optimized for **dialogue**, user assistance, and following instructions in a human-like manner. Instead of just predicting the next token from generic web text, Qwen-Chat models are fine-tuned with techniques like Supervised Fine-Tuning on chat instructions and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) or Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to make them better at being helpful, safe, and aligned in conversation ([Qwen Models: Alibaba’s Next-Generation AI Family for Text, Vision, and Beyond](https://www.inferless.com/learn/the-ultimate-guide-to-qwen-model#:~:text=,tasks%2C%20excelling%20in%20processing%20and)). For example, along with the base Qwen-7B and Qwen-14B, Alibaba released **Qwen-Chat-7B** and **Qwen-Chat-14B**; and similarly in the Qwen1.5 series, each size (0.5B through 72B and beyond) has a corresponding chat model fine-tuned for AI assistant behavior.

Qwen-Chat models are ideal for building **chatbots, virtual assistants, and interactive Q&A systems**. They come pre-trained to handle instructions (“Explain how X works…”) or to engage in multi-turn dialogue while remembering context. All Qwen-Chat variants support the same context lengths as their base model (32K in Qwen1.5, and up to 128K in Qwen2.5), allowing for lengthy conversations or reading long user-provided documents within a chat. They are also **multilingual**, capable of conversing in Chinese, English, and many other languages, switching as needed. Since the Qwen-Chat weights are open-source, developers can deploy them locally or on their own servers (for instance, to avoid external API costs or latency). A 7B Qwen-Chat can run on ~14–16 GB GPU memory (or less with 4-bit quantization), and larger chats like 14B or 32B will need more (28–60 GB). The largest chat models (e.g. Qwen1.5-72B-chat) deliver very strong quality but typically require multi-GPU clusters or cloud instances with high-memory GPUs; for experimentation, one can also access those via cloud APIs (Alibaba Cloud provides Qwen-Chat via its model service, and the community hosts some Qwen-Chat models on Hugging Face’s chatbot platforms).

In summary, Qwen-Chat gives developers a ready-to-use conversational agent model. Use cases include building an AI customer support agent, a coding assistant chat (when combined with Qwen’s coding abilities), or a general-purpose chatbot that can handle tasks akin to ChatGPT. Because Qwen-Chat is open, developers can further fine-tune it on domain-specific dialogues if needed, or integrate it into applications without worrying about license fees.

## Function Calling and Tool Use (Qwen’s API Integration)

One powerful feature of the Qwen models (especially the chat variants) is their support for **function calling**, which allows the LLM to interface with external tools and APIs in a structured way. In practical terms, function calling means the model can output a JSON or other structured format indicating a call to a function (with arguments), rather than just plain text, enabling your application to parse that and execute the function – similar to how OpenAI’s function calling mechanism works. This is extremely useful for building AI agents that can perform actions like database queries, calculations, or fetching live information.

Alibaba has equipped Qwen with strong capabilities for tool use: Qwen models can follow special prompting formats to decide when to “call” a tool and to return well-formatted JSON outputs for those calls ([GitHub - QwenLM/Qwen2.5: Qwen2.5 is the large language model series developed by Qwen team, Alibaba Cloud.](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5#:~:text=,29%20languages%2C%20including%20Chinese%2C%20English)) ([Tongyi Qianwen (Qwen) - Alibaba Cloud](https://www.alibabacloud.com/en/solutions/generative-ai/qwen?_p_lc=1#:~:text=Generate%20JSON%20Code)). For example, you could prompt Qwen-Chat with a set of available functions (say, a `getWeather(city)` API) and the model might respond with a JSON object like `{"function": "getWeather", "args": {"city": "London"}}` when the user asks about London’s weather. Under the hood, Qwen’s training included data for structured output generation, making it adept at this style of response. In fact, Qwen-2.5 specifically improved the reliability of generating structured JSON outputs without errors ([GitHub - QwenLM/Qwen2.5: Qwen2.5 is the large language model series developed by Qwen team, Alibaba Cloud.](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5#:~:text=,29%20languages%2C%20including%20Chinese%2C%20English)).

For developers, there are two main ways to leverage this:

- **Open-Source Implementation:** Using the open model with a prompting template (as documented by the Qwen team) to induce function-call outputs. The Qwen official documentation provides guidance and even an evaluation benchmark for tool use, showing that Qwen-Chat can effectively decide when to use a tool and produce the correct function call format ([Introducing Qwen1.5 | Qwen](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen1.5/#:~:text=match%20at%20L294%20To%20test,appropriately%20select%20and%20use%20tools)). You can integrate this with frameworks like LangChain or your own agent loop. Notably, Qwen’s approach is based on the ReAct (Reason+Act) paradigm, meaning the model can “think” (in a hidden chain-of-thought) and then output an action.
- **Alibaba Cloud API (Model Studio):** Alibaba offers a hosted API for Qwen where function calling is built-in. The API is OpenAI-compatible, so you can use a similar schema as you would with OpenAI’s models for function calls ([Alibaba Cloud Model Studio:Qwen API reference](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/model-studio/developer-reference/use-qwen-by-calling-api#:~:text=Alibaba%20Cloud%20Model%20Studio%3AQwen%20API,compatible.%20Public%20cloud)). The Assistant API will automatically handle the function call formatting and even execution if you connect functions in their console ([Alibaba Cloud Model Studio:Function calling](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/model-studio/user-guide/function-calling#:~:text=Alibaba%20Cloud%20Model%20Studio%3AFunction%20calling,functions%20based%20on%20your%20requirements)). This is convenient if you want a managed solution. (For details, see the _Qwen API reference_ on Alibaba Cloud and the _Function Calling_ section of Model Studio docs.)

In short, **Qwen-Function-Call** is not a separate model but a _capability_ of Qwen models that developers can use to build more interactive and powerful applications. With it, a Qwen-powered assistant can look up information, call APIs, or use calculators, making the AI much more practical. This feature is available in both open-source deployments (with proper prompts) and via API. (If using it via the API, refer to Alibaba’s documentation for the JSON schema and integration examples.)

## Qwen-Coder: Code Generation Model

**Qwen-Coder** (also referred to as _CodeQwen_ in earlier versions) is a specialized variant of Qwen targeted at **programming and software development tasks**. It’s fine-tuned on large amounts of code data, covering dozens of programming languages, in order to serve as an AI coding assistant. Qwen-Coder can generate code given a natural language description, complete your code snippets, help with debugging, and even write explanations for code.

The latest release is **Qwen2.5-Coder**, aligned with the Qwen-2.5 series. According to Alibaba, Qwen2.5-Coder supports a massive **context window of 128K tokens** (like its base model) which is particularly useful for working with lengthy code files or multiple files in one prompt ([Tongyi Qianwen (Qwen) - Alibaba Cloud](https://www.alibabacloud.com/en/solutions/generative-ai/qwen?_p_lc=1#:~:text=Qwen2.5)). It has been trained on **92 programming languages** and various coding benchmarks, achieving strong results in code generation, multi-turn code editing, code completion, and code repair tasks ([Tongyi Qianwen (Qwen) - Alibaba Cloud](https://www.alibabacloud.com/en/solutions/generative-ai/qwen?_p_lc=1#:~:text=Qwen2.5)). This means it’s a well-rounded coding assistant – for example, you can prompt it to “Write a Python function for quicksort” or even have a conversation where you paste an error log and Qwen-Coder suggests a fix. The model is designed to handle not just single-file completion but also more complex scenarios (like generating multiple functions or cooperating with the user to refine code).

Qwen-Coder models are open-source. In the Qwen2.5 generation, multiple sizes have been released (from small ~0.5B up to 32B or more, though the most commonly used are 7B and 14B parameter versions for practical reasons). These checkpoints are available on Hugging Face under the Qwen organization (for example, `Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct` for the 7B chat/instruct tuned coder model). They use the Apache 2.0 license, meaning they can be used in commercial products.

**Deployment and usage:** If your focus is coding assistance, using Qwen-Coder can be more effective than the general Qwen chat model, as it has knowledge of programming syntax and libraries. Developers can run smaller Qwen-Coder models on a single GPU (a 7B model might need ~16 GB memory in float16, or ~8 GB with 4-bit quantization). The largest Qwen2.5-Coder (e.g. 32B) will require more resources (several high-memory GPUs). Qwen-Coder can be accessed via the same interfaces as other Qwens – for instance, through the Transformers library or via Alibaba Cloud’s API (the API offers a model selection; choosing the coder model would give you a code-focused AI similar to GitHub Copilot or OpenAI’s code-davinci). There is also a demo on Hugging Face Spaces and integration with tools like VS Code via third-party extensions.

In summary, **Qwen-Code** provides a powerful open alternative for AI coding tasks, with support for many languages and long context code inputs. It’s well-suited for building features like an “AI pair programmer” in your development environment or an automated code review tool. (For more details or to download models, see the official Qwen2.5-Coder GitHub and Hugging Face pages ([Tongyi Qianwen (Qwen) - Alibaba Cloud](https://www.alibabacloud.com/en/solutions/generative-ai/qwen?_p_lc=1#:~:text=Qwen2.5)).)

## Qwen-VL: Vision-Language Model

**Qwen-VL** is the **vision-language** member of the Qwen family. This model integrates an image understanding component with the language model, enabling it to accept **images (along with text)** as input and to generate text responses that reason about those images. In other words, Qwen-VL can **see and describe**. It belongs to the category of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) and is akin to models like OpenAI’s Vision-capable GPT-4 or Meta’s LLaVA, allowing for tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering (VQA), and multimodal dialogue.

Qwen-VL can take in one or more images (plus optional bounding box annotations) and text prompts, then produce outputs that combine visual and textual understanding ([The official repo of Qwen-VL (通义千问-VL) chat ... - GitHub](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-VL#:~:text=Qwen,VL)) ([Tongyi Qianwen (Qwen) - Alibaba Cloud](https://www.alibabacloud.com/en/solutions/generative-ai/qwen?_p_lc=1#:~:text=Qwen)). For example, you could show Qwen-VL a photograph and ask, “What is happening in this image?” or “Describe this picture in detail,” and it will generate a descriptive answer. It can also handle more complex requests, like comparing two images, reading text within an image (it has strong OCR capabilities in both Chinese and English ([Tongyi Qianwen (Qwen) - Alibaba Cloud](https://www.alibabacloud.com/en/solutions/generative-ai/qwen?_p_lc=1#:~:text=Qwen,math%20problems%2C%20or%20answer%20questions))), or solving a task from a diagram or chart. Impressively, Qwen-VL’s abilities include **fine-grained analysis** – it can identify objects, their attributes, and relationships in images. Alibaba’s benchmarks indicate Qwen-VL achieves state-of-the-art results among general-purpose vision-language models of comparable size ([The official repo of Qwen-VL (通义千问-VL) chat ... - GitHub](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-VL#:~:text=Qwen,VL)).

([Tongyi Qianwen (Qwen) - Alibaba Cloud](https://www.alibabacloud.com/en/solutions/generative-ai/qwen?_p_lc=1)) _Example: Qwen-VL can **generate images** as well. Based on a text prompt describing a “young girl portrait” with certain attributes, Qwen-VL produced this illustration in a specified style. This demonstrates Qwen-VL’s ability not only to understand images but also to create visual content from textual descriptions ([Tongyi Qianwen (Qwen) - Alibaba Cloud](https://www.alibabacloud.com/en/solutions/generative-ai/qwen?_p_lc=1#:~:text=Based%20on%20text%20prompts%20and,specific%20scenarios))._

Initially, **Qwen-VL-7B** (with a 7-billion-parameter text backbone plus vision encoder) and **Qwen-VL-Chat** (its instruction-tuned version) were released (August 2023). These are open-source (Apache 2.0) and available on ModelScope and Hugging Face ([Qwen-VL - Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen-VL#:~:text=We%20release%20Qwen,refer%20to%20our%20technical%20memo)) ([The official repo of Qwen-VL (通义千问-VL) chat ... - GitHub](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-VL#:~:text=2023.8.22%20We%20release%20both%20Qwen,the%20generalist%20LVLM%20scale%20settings)). Subsequently, Alibaba continued to improve the model: **Qwen2-VL** (second-gen Vision-LM) and the latest **Qwen2.5-VL** have also been introduced. Qwen2.5-VL models come in various scales – for instance, 3B, 7B, and even a 72B multimodal model – indicating a very large vision-language model is available ([Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct - Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct#:~:text=Qwen%2FQwen2.5,Language%20Model%20for)). The larger models would have even stronger image understanding (at the cost of heavy computation). Qwen-VL models support at least the same context lengths as their text-only counterparts (e.g. 32K or more tokens of text, plus image inputs). They are multilingual in the sense that you can ask questions in different languages and the model will answer in that language, and they can describe image text in both Chinese and English ([Tongyi Qianwen (Qwen) - Alibaba Cloud](https://www.alibabacloud.com/en/solutions/generative-ai/qwen?_p_lc=1#:~:text=Qwen,math%20problems%2C%20or%20answer%20questions)).

**Use cases:** Qwen-VL is ideal for building applications like a smart **image analysis chatbot** (for example, a user uploads a picture and asks questions about it), a **visual assistant for the visually impaired** (describing surroundings or images), or for analyzing diagrams in documents. It can also be used in creative tools: given its ability to generate some images (the tech memo notes it can produce images in various styles from prompts ([Tongyi Qianwen (Qwen) - Alibaba Cloud](https://www.alibabacloud.com/en/solutions/generative-ai/qwen?_p_lc=1#:~:text=Based%20on%20text%20prompts%20and,specific%20scenarios)), likely by integrating with a diffusion model), one could imagine a multimodal content creation assistant.

**Running Qwen-VL:** Because Qwen-VL involves image processing, it requires an additional vision backbone (e.g. a Vision Transformer) integrated with the model. The open releases make this seamless for the user – using the Hugging Face Transformers API, you can load Qwen-VL and simply provide image tensors plus text. The 7B version can be run on a GPU with ~24 GB memory (for full precision) or lower with optimized settings; when using images, also consider GPU memory for the image encoder (usually a few hundred million parameters extra). There are demos in ModelScope where you can try Qwen-VL online. For larger versions like 72B, running locally is extremely challenging; those are mostly for research or available via cloud due to their size. For most developers, the 7B or 14B Qwen-VL will be the sweet spot for on-premises use. If an API option is preferred, Alibaba’s Model Studio offers Qwen-VL as a service – you can send an image and prompt to the API and get a JSON with the answer.

In summary, **Qwen-VL** brings vision to the Qwen family – it’s a capable multimodal model that **understands images and text together**, enabling a range of vision-and-language AI applications. It is open-source and backed by Alibaba’s continued development (with Qwen2-VL and beyond), making it a strong candidate for anyone needing an LVLM.

## Qwen-Audio: Audio-Language Model

**Qwen-Audio** extends Qwen’s capabilities to the **audio domain**. This model can accept **audio inputs (along with or instead of text)** and produce textual outputs. Essentially, Qwen-Audio is to audio-and-text as Qwen-VL is to vision-and-text. It’s sometimes described as a “Large Audio Language Model,” meaning it treats audio in a similar way to language – enabling understanding and generation across modalities. Qwen-Audio is designed to excel in processing and understanding various types of audio: human speech, natural sounds, music, and even singing ([Qwen Models: Alibaba’s Next-Generation AI Family for Text, Vision, and Beyond](https://www.inferless.com/learn/the-ultimate-guide-to-qwen-model#:~:text=%2A%20Qwen,solving%2C%20this%20model%20aids%20in)) ([Tongyi Qianwen (Qwen) - Alibaba Cloud](https://www.alibabacloud.com/en/solutions/generative-ai/qwen?_p_lc=1#:~:text=Qwen)).

With Qwen-Audio, developers can tackle tasks such as:

- **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR):** Transcribing spoken words to text.
- **Audio Content Analysis:** Identifying what’s happening in an audio clip (e.g. “a dog barking and a doorbell ringing”), classifying environmental sounds, or determining characteristics of the speaker (accent, emotion, gender, etc.).
- **Audio Question Answering:** The model can listen to an audio (or a segment within a video) and answer questions about it.
- **Speech Understanding for Dialogue:** The model can take an audio query from a user and respond conversationally in text, effectively allowing voice input to a chatbot. It can also reason about how to reply considering the user’s tone or intent.

Alibaba’s technical report on Qwen-Audio notes that the model achieved impressive results on benchmarks **without task-specific fine-tuning** ([Tongyi Qianwen (Qwen) - Alibaba Cloud](https://www.alibabacloud.com/en/solutions/generative-ai/qwen?_p_lc=1#:~:text=Qwen,Aishell1%2C%20cochlscene%2C%20ClothoAQA%2C%20and%20VocalSound)). For instance, it performs well on Aishell-1 (a Mandarin speech recognition dataset), and other tests like Clotho (an audio question answering benchmark) and VocalSound (possibly a sound classification dataset), indicating robust out-of-the-box audio understanding. This suggests that Qwen-Audio was trained on a broad set of audio-transcription and audio-description data to generalize to various audio tasks.

([Tongyi Qianwen (Qwen) - Alibaba Cloud](https://www.alibabacloud.com/en/solutions/generative-ai/qwen?_p_lc=1)) _Example: Qwen-Audio analyzing a short voice clip. In this demo, the **user’s audio** (top) contains a person speaking. The prompt asks the model to recognize the speaker’s attributes (gender, age, accent, emotion) and the content of speech, then respond accordingly. **Tongyi (Qwen-Audio)** produces a detailed textual analysis and a suitable reply, demonstrating its comprehension of the audio input and conversational ability._

**Model details:** The open-source release of Qwen-Audio (often called **Qwen2-Audio-7B** for the second-gen version) uses a 7B parameter language model combined with an audio encoder front-end ([Qwen/Qwen2-Audio-7B - Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2-Audio-7B#:~:text=Qwen%2FQwen2,with%20regard%20to%20speech)). It likely employs a module (such as a pretrained Wav2Vec or a custom audio transformer) to convert raw audio waveforms into embeddings that are fed into the model, allowing it to handle audio similarly to how vision models handle images. The context window for text in Qwen-Audio is similar to base Qwen (e.g., 8K or more tokens), but when you include audio, the “effective” context is split between audio frames and text tokens. In practice, you might provide up to e.g. 30 seconds of audio along with some text instructions. Qwen-Audio is bilingual for speech (Chinese and English are explicitly supported in speech tasks) and likely can handle other languages to some extent if they were in the training audio. The model outputs text, so if the task is transcribing speech, the output is the transcribed text; if the task is to answer a question about a sound, the output is the answer in text. (It does not directly output audio.)

**Availability:** Qwen-Audio is open-source (Apache 2.0) and available on Hugging Face ([Qwen/Qwen-Audio - Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen-Audio#:~:text=Qwen,%E5%8C%85%E6%8B%AC%E8%AF%B4%E8%AF%9D%E4%BA%BA%E8%AF%AD%E9%9F%B3%E3%80%81%E8%87%AA%E7%84%B6%E9%9F%B3%E3%80%81%E9%9F%B3%E4%B9%90%E3%80%81%E6%AD%8C%E5%A3%B0%EF%BC%89%E5%92%8C%E6%96%87%E6%9C%AC%E4%BD%9C%E4%B8%BA%E8%BE%93%E5%85%A5%EF%BC%8C%E5%B9%B6%E4%BB%A5%E6%96%87%E6%9C%AC)) and ModelScope. Alibaba also provides a _Qwen-Audio-Chat_ model fine-tuned for conversational scenarios with audio (e.g., a voice assistant). To use it, you’d load the model and feed audio in the format expected (the Qwen team provides utilities for audio processing, as noted in their documentation). Running Qwen-Audio requires a bit more setup than text models: you need to handle audio file reading and possibly feature extraction. However, the model itself at 7B parameters can run on a single high-end GPU (similar requirements to Qwen-7B) for inference, aside from the extra CPU/GPU work to process audio input. There may be memory overhead depending on audio length. Tools like Hugging Face Transformers and ModelScope have pipelines to simplify usage.

In summary, **Qwen-Audio** allows developers to build AI features that understand spoken or sound input. Whether it’s a voice-controlled chatbot, an AI that can listen to calls and gauge customer sentiment ([Qwen Models: Alibaba’s Next-Generation AI Family for Text, Vision, and Beyond](https://www.inferless.com/learn/the-ultimate-guide-to-qwen-model#:~:text=operational%20efficiency.%20Qwen,more%20empathetic%20and%20tailored%20responses)), or a multimedia assistant that can hear and see, Qwen-Audio provides the building blocks. Being open-source, it stands out as one of the more accessible large audio-language models available for local deployment and customization.

## Qwen-Omni (Qwen-Mix): All-in-One Multimodal Model

One of the most ambitious members of the Qwen family is **Qwen2.5-Omni-7B**, which we can refer to as **Qwen-Omni** (sometimes informally called Qwen-Mix, as it mixes multiple modality inputs). “Omni” is Latin for “all,” and indeed, Qwen-Omni is an **end-to-end multimodal AI model that handles text, images, audio, and video inputs simultaneously** ([Qwen2.5-Omni-7B: A Multimodal AI That Thinks Like a Human Across Text, Image, Audio, and Video: A Step-by-Step Installation Tutorial | by Md Monsur ali | Mar, 2025 | Level Up Coding](https://medium.com/@monsuralirana/qwen2-5-omni-7b-a-multimodal-ai-that-thinks-like-a-human-across-text-image-audio-and-video-a-8e4b37b4c1c4#:~:text=Qwen2.5,creation%2C%20and%20interactive%20AI%20systems)). This model aims to “do it all” – see, hear, and read, then respond through language (and even speech). It effectively combines the capabilities of Qwen-VL and Qwen-Audio, and extends them to basic video understanding, in a single unified model architecture.

Key characteristics of Qwen-Omni include:

- **Multimodal Input:** You can feed it a prompt that includes any combination of text, one or more images, audio clips, and even short video clips (which are sequences of images+audio). The model encodes all these inputs and considers them jointly ([Qwen2.5-Omni-7B: A Multimodal AI That Thinks Like a Human Across Text, Image, Audio, and Video: A Step-by-Step Installation Tutorial | by Md Monsur ali | Mar, 2025 | Level Up Coding](https://medium.com/@monsuralirana/qwen2-5-omni-7b-a-multimodal-ai-that-thinks-like-a-human-across-text-image-audio-and-video-a-8e4b37b4c1c4#:~:text=Key%20Features%20of%20Qwen2.5)). For example, you might input: an image and ask “What’s in this image?”, _plus_ an audio clip and ask “What sound is this?”, and Qwen-Omni can handle both in one go.
- **Text and Speech Output:** The model’s primary output is text (like describing what it saw/heard). Notably, Qwen2.5-Omni is designed to support **streaming outputs** – it can generate responses token by token in real-time, which is useful for interactive applications ([Qwen2.5-Omni-7B: A Multimodal AI That Thinks Like a Human Across Text, Image, Audio, and Video: A Step-by-Step Installation Tutorial | by Md Monsur ali | Mar, 2025 | Level Up Coding](https://medium.com/@monsuralirana/qwen2-5-omni-7b-a-multimodal-ai-that-thinks-like-a-human-across-text-image-audio-and-video-a-8e4b37b4c1c4#:~:text=,as%20chatbots%20and%20virtual%20assistants)). Additionally, it has been reported to support generating speech output for its responses ([Qwen2.5-Omni-7B: A Multimodal AI That Thinks Like a Human Across Text, Image, Audio, and Video: A Step-by-Step Installation Tutorial | by Md Monsur ali | Mar, 2025 | Level Up Coding](https://medium.com/@monsuralirana/qwen2-5-omni-7b-a-multimodal-ai-that-thinks-like-a-human-across-text-image-audio-and-video-a-8e4b37b4c1c4#:~:text=,for%20both%20research%20and%20production)). This suggests that Qwen-Omni might integrate a text-to-speech component or at least produce an intermediate representation that can be turned into audio. In practice, this means Qwen-Omni could potentially answer you not just in text but also with a spoken voice, making it a truly multimodal communicator.
- **Unified Architecture:** Unlike having separate encoders for image, audio, etc., Qwen-Omni uses a unified model that encodes different modalities in a common space ([Qwen2.5-Omni-7B: A Multimodal AI That Thinks Like a Human Across Text, Image, Audio, and Video: A Step-by-Step Installation Tutorial | by Md Monsur ali | Mar, 2025 | Level Up Coding](https://medium.com/@monsuralirana/qwen2-5-omni-7b-a-multimodal-ai-that-thinks-like-a-human-across-text-image-audio-and-video-a-8e4b37b4c1c4#:~:text=,complex%20queries%20with%20multiple%20input)). This end-to-end approach allows the model to **understand context across modalities** more holistically. For instance, it could watch a muted video (images) and listen to an unrelated sound and determine if they match or not – something that requires cross-modal reasoning.
- **Size and Efficiency:** The released Qwen2.5-Omni is a 7B parameter model (for the text part). This relatively moderate size was chosen so that the model is tractable to run; despite handling multiple data types, it’s optimized for both research and production use with efficiency in mind ([Qwen2.5-Omni-7B: A Multimodal AI That Thinks Like a Human Across Text, Image, Audio, and Video: A Step-by-Step Installation Tutorial | by Md Monsur ali | Mar, 2025 | Level Up Coding](https://medium.com/@monsuralirana/qwen2-5-omni-7b-a-multimodal-ai-that-thinks-like-a-human-across-text-image-audio-and-video-a-8e4b37b4c1c4#:~:text=%2A%20End,Available%20for%20developers%20and%20researchers)). Developers with a high-end GPU can run Qwen-Omni locally. In terms of resource needs: to process video, the model might use fewer frames (e.g., one frame per second of video or similar) to stay within memory limits. Qwen-Omni uses streaming and chunking for long inputs, meaning it can handle e.g. a 1-minute video by processing it in parts. Memory-wise, plan for what a 7B model requires (~16 GB GPU RAM in full precision) plus some overhead for the additional modality processors. The model is open-source and available (Hugging Face, GitHub, etc.) for anyone to experiment with ([Qwen/Qwen2.5-Omni-7B - Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Omni-7B#:~:text=Qwen2.5,audio%2C%20and%20video%2C%20while)).

**Applications:** Qwen-Omni opens up new possibilities where an AI needs to **combine multiple senses**. For example, an “AI assistant for video content” could take a YouTube video (visual + audio) as input and answer questions about it or summarize it. In customer service, an Omni model could analyze a video call (seeing the scene, hearing the voice) to assist a support agent. In robotics, an agent with Omni capabilities could receive camera feeds and sound input and reason about its environment in text form. Another use case is content creation: a user could provide an image and ask the model to tell a story about it with sound effects (Omni could describe the scene and even suggest audio). The unified model also shines in **complex queries** where context from multiple sources is needed. For instance, “Look at this chart (image) and this speech segment (audio); do they refer to the same sales figures?” – an Omni model can handle that comprehensively.

It’s worth noting that Qwen-Omni is at the cutting edge, being a research preview in 2025. While it’s open, it might not yet be as polished on each modality as the dedicated Qwen-VL or Qwen-Audio. However, it represents the direction of LLMs to be ever more versatile. Alibaba published a technical report on Qwen2.5-Omni (and there’s an arXiv paper ([[2503.20215] Qwen2.5-Omni Technical Report - arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20215#:~:text=%5B2503.20215%5D%20Qwen2.5,including%20text%2C%20images%2C%20audio%2C))) for those interested in the technical details. For developers, if your application demands an AI that can **“see, hear, and talk” all at once**, Qwen-Omni is one of the first ready options to try.

## Qwen2.5-Max: Mixture-of-Experts Scaling (Qwen-MoE)

To push the limits of model size and intelligence, Alibaba has also developed **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** versions of Qwen. The MoE architecture allows a model to have a vastly larger number of parameters by partitioning them into “experts” (sub-models) and activating only some experts per query, which improves scalability without linearly increasing computation for every token. The flagship in this category is **Qwen2.5-Max**, which can be seen as the MoE counterpart of the dense Qwen-2.5 series. Qwen2.5-Max is a _large-scale MoE model trained on over 20 trillion tokens_ ([Qwen2.5-Max: Exploring the Intelligence of Large-scale MoE Model | Qwen](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-max/#:~:text=extremely%20large%20models%2C%20whether%20they,Max%20on%20%205%20Qwen)). While Alibaba hasn’t publicly disclosed the exact parameter count, it is implied to be extremely high – likely on the order of several hundred billion parameters (for comparison, they mention it competing with DeepSeek V3 and “Llama-3.1-405B”, the latter presumably a 405B parameter dense model ([Qwen2.5-Max: Exploring the Intelligence of Large-scale MoE Model | Qwen](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-max/#:~:text=in%20other%20assessments%2C%20including%20MMLU))). By using MoE, Qwen2.5-Max achieves this scale by having many expert subnetworks, but at inference it only uses a fraction of them per input, making it more efficient than a same-size dense model.

**Performance:** Qwen2.5-Max has demonstrated **leading performance on a range of benchmarks**, outperforming other open models and even challenging some proprietary ones ([Qwen2.5-Max: Exploring the Intelligence of Large-scale MoE Model | Qwen](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-max/#:~:text=serve%20for%20downstream%20applications%20such,Sonnet)). Alibaba reported that Qwen2.5-Max outstrips DeepSeek V3 (another large MoE model) on benchmarks like Arena-Hard (for complex Q&A and reasoning), LiveBench (general tasks), LiveCodeBench (coding tasks), and GPQA-Diamond (a difficult question-answering set), and is competitive on academic benchmarks like MMLU (knowledge) ([Qwen2.5-Max: Exploring the Intelligence of Large-scale MoE Model | Qwen](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-max/#:~:text=problems%2C%20LiveCodeBench%2C%20which%20assesses%20coding,base%20models%20and%20instruct%20models)) ([Qwen2.5-Max: Exploring the Intelligence of Large-scale MoE Model | Qwen](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-max/#:~:text=Qwen2.5,Pro)). In essence, it is one of the most powerful models they have built, leveraging its scale for better results in knowledge, reasoning, coding, and alignment (they applied SFT and RLHF to it as well).

**Availability:** Unlike the other Qwen models, **Qwen2.5-Max (MoE)** is currently not offered as an openly downloadable model – due to its sheer size and complexity, it’s provided via **API access** on Alibaba Cloud. Developers who want to tap into its power can use the Qwen API (for instance, through Alibaba Cloud’s Model Studio or via the Qwen Chat web interface) where Qwen2.5-Max is available as one of the model options ([Qwen2.5-Max: Exploring the Intelligence of Large-scale MoE Model | Qwen](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-max/#:~:text=Today%2C%20we%20are%20excited%20to,Max%20on%20Qwen%20Chat)). By using the API, you don’t need to handle the heavy computation; Alibaba runs the model on their servers and returns the inference results. This is useful for experimentation or if you need top-tier performance for a particular task and are okay with cloud usage. Keep in mind that API access may have costs associated and latency will be higher than running a small model locally.

For most developers, Qwen-MoE is something to be aware of for the future – it shows the scalability of the Qwen family. Alibaba’s work on MoE (including a smaller **Qwen1.5-MoE-2.7B** demonstration model they open-sourced earlier as a proof-of-concept) indicates that they might open-source larger MoE models down the line, or at least continue to improve their APIs. If your use case might benefit from the absolute highest accuracy and you don’t mind using a cloud service, Qwen2.5-Max is an option to consider. It can be integrated similarly to other Qwen models via API calls (the _OpenAI-compatible_ interface means you could swap it in for an OpenAI model ID in many client libraries easily). For now, think of **Qwen-MoE** as the cutting-edge, **“power mode”** of the Qwen family – extremely potent, but accessed through the cloud.

Still cutting-edge; primarily for experimentation and specialized applications.
- **Qwen2.5-Max (MoE model):** A **Mixture-of-Experts** large model (hundreds of billions of params effective). Proprietary (weights not publicly downloadable). Excels in knowledge, reasoning, code – one of the top-performing models in Alibaba’s lineup ([Qwen2.5-Max: Exploring the Intelligence of Large-scale MoE Model | Qwen](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-max/#:~:text=serve%20for%20downstream%20applications%20such,Sonnet)). Use cases: when maximum accuracy is needed and an API can be used. **Access via API only**: provided through Alibaba Cloud API and Qwen Chat interface ([Qwen2.5-Max: Exploring the Intelligence of Large-scale MoE Model | Qwen](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-max/#:~:text=Today%2C%20we%20are%20excited%20to,Max%20on%20Qwen%20Chat)). Not runnable locally due to scale. No cost for open-source download (since not open), but cloud usage may incur fees.

Each of these models addresses different developer needs. Because they share a common lineage, you will find it relatively easy to switch between them or use them together. For example, you might use Qwen-Chat as a general conversation agent, and when the user uploads an image, seamlessly hand off to Qwen-VL to analyze it, then continue the dialogue. Alibaba’s unified platform (Model Studio) actually allows you to select these model variants as needed, and the open-source nature means you could also combine them in your own system.

## Conclusion

The Qwen model family provides a **diverse and powerful toolkit** for AI-powered application development. Whether you need a strong general-purpose language model (Qwen-2.5), a conversational chatbot (Qwen-Chat), a coding assistant (Qwen-Coder), vision or audio understanding (Qwen-VL, Qwen-Audio), or a cutting-edge multi-sense AI (Qwen-Omni), Alibaba’s Qwen lineup has a model for the task. Importantly, most of these models are open-source with permissive licensing, lowering the barrier for developers to experiment and deploy them. They come with high token limits, multi-language support, and integration options ranging from local GPU inference to cloud APIs, giving developers flexibility in how to use them. As a definitive reference, keep this guide handy when evaluating Qwen models for your projects – you can mix and match the Qwen variants to build rich, intelligent applications that see, hear, and understand the world through language.
